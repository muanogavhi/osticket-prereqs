</p>
<p>
Ticket Assignment: Tickets are supposed to be assigned based on priority and category. Sometimes the end user will not label their tickets correctly, and it is up to the help desk support to fix them so we can address the issue appropriately.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>
This project gave me hands-on experience with setting up and managing a help desk system, demonstrating my ability to configure both the backend and operational side of IT ticket management and get familiar with a ticketing system environment as both an administrator and help desk support agent.
